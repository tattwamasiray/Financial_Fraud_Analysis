# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model Analysis

## Introduction

This section analyzes the performance of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset.  
The model classifies transactions into fraudulent (class 1) or non-fraudulent (class 0) categories.

## Metrics Summary

### Class 0 (Non-Fraudulent Transactions)

| Metric    | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Precision | 1.00  |
| Recall    | 0.95  |
| F1-Score  | 0.97  |

### Class 1 (Fraudulent Transactions)

| Metric    | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Precision | 0.05  |
| Recall    | 0.86  |
| F1-Score  | 0.09  |

### Accuracy

| Metric    | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Accuracy  | 0.95  |

## Insights

- The model excels in accurately identifying non-fraudulent transactions with a high precision rate.  
- For fraudulent transactions, the model faces a precision-recall trade-off, impacting its accuracy.  
- A visual representation of performance is provided by the included confusion matrix.  

## Conclusion

The KNN model demonstrates promise in effectively recognizing non-fraudulent transactions. However, its performance in detecting fraudulent transactions requires further refinement to achieve a better balance between precision and recall.  
Suggested improvements include fine-tuning the model, enhancing feature engineering, and considering alternative algorithms.
